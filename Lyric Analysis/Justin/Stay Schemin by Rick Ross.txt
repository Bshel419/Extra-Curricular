RIP to all the real niggas worldwide
Salute, Real Shit

I ride for my niggas dawg, I ride for my niggas
I slide for my niggas dawg, I ride for my niggas 

Stay schemin'
Niggas tryna get at me (dawg)
I ride for my niggas
Stay schemin'
Niggas tryna get at me (dawg)
I ride for my niggas

Damn, life so short, fuck it, I don't wanna go to court
Fuck it, got a budget for the lawyer though
Fuck it, I'm on the run for the money
I'm in the bucket, paid 200 for it
My lil' niggas thuggin', even got me paranoid
I'm gettin' money, that's in any nigga category
Double M I got G's out in California

I ride for my niggas dawg, I ride for my niggas
I slide for my niggas dawg, I ride for my niggas 

Stay schemin'
Niggas tryna get at me (dawg)
I ride for my niggas
Stay schemin'
Niggas tryna get at me (dawg)
I ride for my niggas

It bothers me when the Gods get to acting like the broads
Guess every team doesn't come complete with niggas like ours
That's why I see no need to compete with niggas like y'all
I just ask that when you see me you speak up niggas that's all
Don't be ducking like you never wanted nothing
It's feeling like rap change
There was a time it was rugged
Back when if a nigga reached it was for the weapon
Nowadays niggas reach, just to sell they record
Spaguetti bolognese in apollo lounge
Me and my G from DC, that's how I roll around
Might look light, but we heavy though
You think drake would pull some sh-t like that you never know
Million dollar meetings in apollo lounge
Me and my man Oliver North, that's how I roll around
Shorty wanted to tell me secrets about a rap nigga
I told that bitch it's more attractive when you hold it down
Kobe about to lose a hundred fifty M's
Kobe my nigga I hate it had to be him
Bitch you wasn't with me shooting in the gym
(huh!? bitch you weren't with me shooting in the gym)

Tell lucien, and I say fuck it
I'm tearing holes my budget
Bag it like we in Publix
And take her ass out in public
Order her a filet told her butterflies, she'll love it
She's used to soda and nuggets, she's really just out here thugging
I'm just hitting my pinnacle
You and pussy identical
You like the fucking finish line
We can't wait to run into you
But let me get my mind off that young rich motherfucker getting mine off rap, with my niggas!

I ride for my niggas dawg, I ride for my niggas
I slide for my niggas dawg, I ride for my niggas 

Stay schemin'
Niggas tryna get at me (dawg)
I ride for my niggas
Stay schemin'
Niggas tryna get at me (dawg)
I ride for my niggas

From hooptie coupe to the Ghost dawg
Pigeons on the roof like ghost dawg
Dwight Howard on the post dawg
My niggas got the powder through the post dawg
Watch the body tilt when you hit the head
Niggas lost mills tryna beat the feds
10 grams off my last 250 now
Big ass crib, 250 down, damn
Gave my nigga Mac 75
Then gave my nigga penthouse in another 30
Fuck got me thinking like I'm 75
Damn, nigga aint even seen 30

I ride for my niggas dawg, I ride for my niggas
I slide for my niggas dawg, I ride for my niggas 

Stay schemin'
Niggas tryna get at me (dawg)
I ride for my niggas
Stay schemin'
Niggas tryna get at me (dawg)
I ride for my niggas
