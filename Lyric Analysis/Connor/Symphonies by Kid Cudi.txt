I can't disguise I was hypnotized
Lost the track, struggled back
I'd wanted easy stuff to please me
Something in the dark began to squeeze me

Seen it there, thinner in the mirror
Totally focused, no hocus pocus
Dare I give in to this thing gripping my skin
To win, thinking how to

As the lights of the cars go by in a stream
Seems like I stand pretty much unseen
But I open my eyes and beams come out

Gimme, gimme symphonies
Gimme more than the life I see
Score rise up, angels play
Let my loneliness get blown away

Gimme, gimme symphonies
Gimme more than the life I see

I lie down in the dust just under your eye
A scrap of paper, thin as vapour
Filling my clothes like smoke
A couple of the wires in my heart are broke

I float, I miss something, nothing but
Dreams, schemes, moments wasted
Taste I tasted, fate I'm fated
Re-edited again then copy/pasted

As the lights of the cars go by in a stream
Seems like I stand pretty much unseen
But I open my eyes and beams come out

Gimme, gimme symphonies
Gimme more than the life I see
(Score rise up, angels play
Let my loneliness get blown away)

Gimme, gimme, symphonies
Gimme more than the life I see

When I wanna quit, I suffocate it
I chew Bubblicious, stress repetitious
Vicious, I'm one outsider
Up above the streets on the DC wire

Higher, fire in my guts
In a rut, but what I've got
Is in no can, no other human
But I do get lonely, scared I'm phony

As the lights of the cars go by in a stream
Seems like I stand pretty much unseen
But I open my eyes and beams come out

Gimme, gimme symphonies
Gimme more than the life I see
Score rise up, angels play
Let my loneliness get blown away

Gimme, gimme symphonies
Gimme more than the life I see

Gimme, gimme symphonies
Gimme more than the life I see
Gimme, gimme symphonies
