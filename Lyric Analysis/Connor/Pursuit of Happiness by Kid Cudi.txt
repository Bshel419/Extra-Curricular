Crush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit
Feelin’ lit, feelin’ light, 2 AM summer night.
I don't care, hand on the wheel, driving drunk, I'm doin’ my thing
Rollin the Midwest side and out livin’ my life getting’ out dreams
People told me slow my roll I'm screaming out fuck that
Imma do just what I want lookin’ ahead no turnin’ back
If I fall if I die know I lived it to the fullest
If I fall if I die know I lived and missed some bullets

I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold, hey
I'll be fine once I get it, yeah
I'll be good.

I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold, hey

Tell me what you know about dreamin’ dreamin’
You don't really know about nothin’ nothin’
Tell me what you know about them night terrors every night
5 AM, cold sweats wakin’ up to the sky
Tell me what you know about dreams, dreams
Tell me what you know about night terrors, nothin’
You don't really care about the trials of tomorrow
Rather lay awake in a bed full of sorrow

I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold, hey
I'll be fine once I get it, yeah
I'll be good.

Oh man, oh, uh, room's spinning, room's spinning.
That was really quick.

Oh, God, why did I drink so much and smoke so much, ah
Ah, fuck it
