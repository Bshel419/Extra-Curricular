    There is no blood alcohol calculator that is 100% accurate because of the numerous factors and complexities relating to alcohol consumption by of different individuals.
    In addition to the gender, body weight and amount of alcohol consumed in a time period, blood alcohol content of any individual person is influenced by that personâ€™s metabolism, health issues, medications taken, history of alcohol consumption and the amount of food and non-alcoholic beverages eaten before or during alcohol consumption, among other factors.
    The best that can be done is a rough estimation of the BAC level based on known inputs.</string>
